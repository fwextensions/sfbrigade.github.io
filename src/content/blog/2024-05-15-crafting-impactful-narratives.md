On May 15, 2024, SF Civic Tech, in collaboration with [Technologists for the Public Good](https://www.publicgood.tech/), hosted an inspiring event entitled *Crafting Impactful Narratives: Presenting on Public Interest Tech*. This event was our first in-person event post-Covid, bringing together cross-sector professionals and enthusiasts dedicated to making a difference in the public sector. Held alongside our [civic hack night](https://www.meetup.com/sfcivictech/), the event featured insightful presentations from leading voices in the field.


## Event Highlights

We had the privilege of hearing from three veterans in civic tech who shared their expertise on presenting work in public interest technology:

Tom emphasized the importance of storytelling in public applications. Drawing from Jennifer Pahlka’s book *Recoding America*, he highlighted why simplifying problems, humanizing stories, and focusing on transformative journeys are crucial. His five key qualities for impactful narratives include:

* Simplifying the problem
* Telling human stories
* Outlining the “before,” “during,” and “after”
* Answering “so what”
* Ending with a vision

Nick introduced us to the Liberatory Framework, a visionary approach integrating STEM education with social equity. His curriculum includes geospatial data analytics, race, power, and technology, and self-directed student capstones. Nick stressed the importance of documenting work, ensuring accessibility, and presenting narratives that connect and inspire action.


## Key Takeaways

The event underscored how each of us can make a significant impact on our communities. By understanding the power of effective storytelling, engaging with stakeholders, and focusing on measurable impact, we can drive meaningful change. It all starts with the desire to see a difference and the willingness to take action.

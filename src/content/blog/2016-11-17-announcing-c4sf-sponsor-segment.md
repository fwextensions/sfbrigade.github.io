### Code for San Francisco is happy to announce that Segment has contributed $5,047 to support our efforts. A huge, sincere thank you to Segment!

[Segment](https://segment.com)’s generosity will make it possible to continue serving meals to everyone who volunteers at our weekly hack nights. Code for San Francisco is an all volunteer organization working to use technology to improve the city. Our hack nights run on donated time, donated talent, donated space, and donated meals. 

> Code for San Francisco really embodies some of the values Segment holds dear, Karma and Drive. We are grateful to have the opportunity to help with such an awesome cause and very excited to see what types of projects will come out of this endeavour.
> - Laylee Asgari, with Segment

Code for San Francisco would like to give a special shoutout to the brigade’s veteran, [Oz Haven](https://github.com/therebelrobot), for his efforts in reaching out to Segment. A big thank you to Oz for continuing and maintaining Code for San Francisco’s drive to build socially impactful technology.

Segment’s substantial support will cover about a fourth of our fundraising goal for 2016. Code for San Francisco looks forward to using this donation to fuel our volunteers efforts to build civic tech projects. Our brigade has several active projects and is welcoming new volunteers every week.

Segment’s donation shows how far a well placed donation can go. If you or your company are looking for ways to contribute to Code for San Francisco, drop us a line at [fundraising@codeforsanfrancisco.org](mailto:fundraising@codeforsanfrancisco.org)

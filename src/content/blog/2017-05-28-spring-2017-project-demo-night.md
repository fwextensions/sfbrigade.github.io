title: Spring 2017 Project Demo Night
description: There’s nothing like a Demo Night to help a team focus their presentation and take stock of where they are in their project. It is also a great opportunity to recruit for their project and show the rest of the Brigade the work they’ve been up to. Eleven teams presented their projects and the progress the teams are making is inspiring. The project teams are working on a wide range of issues facing San Francisco residents from helping the homeless to analyzing juvenile justice sentencing disparities. Check out the videos from the teams presentations and join us every Wednesday night hacking for San Francisco!

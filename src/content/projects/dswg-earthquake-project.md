name: DSWG Earthquake Project
description: |-
  The Data Science Working Group has started a new project to build a simple website to help a user determine if an SF address is a soft-story property. The goal is to make the existing data fully usable and visible to renters and buyers in SF. Ultimately, we hope that this awareness can encourage property owners and developers to improve the earthquake rating of their buildings in the city and reduce SFâ€™s overall vulnerability to disaster.

  Less than half of nearly 28,000 people experiencing homelessness in the Bay Area have reliable access to the internet.
  
  ShelterTech is a technology-focused nonprofit organization making it easier for this community to connect with resources that can help them address their challenges.
  
  Begun as a project at Code for San Francisco, ShelterTech spun-off into it's own organization in 2006 and has grown to a volunteer organization with an annual budget over $100k.

  Plan your entire ballot in 6 minutes!
  
  We are creating easy-to-use tools that cut through the election noise and help voters easily understand what's on their ballot. Our open platform empowers voters to create and share voter guides that aggregate information and opinions across personal networks. So you can help your friends be better voters too.
  
  WeVote started at Code for San Francisco in 2014, and spun-off into an independent, open-source ballot information system.
